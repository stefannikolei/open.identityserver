Open.IdentityServer is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET.

.. note:: 
   Open.IdentityServer is an independent open‑source project led by Rock Solid Knowledge, based on the Apache 2.0 licensed IdentityServer4 codebase. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Duende Software or the original IdentityServer4 authors.

   At Rock Solid Knowledge, we are committed to keeping Open.IdentityServer free open source indefinitely. Additional products and services are available on `IdentityServer.com <https://www.identityserver.com/>`_, which contribute to the long-term sustainability of the project.


Open.IdentityServer enables the following features in your applications:

| **Authentication as a Service** 
| Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services). Open.IdentityServer is an implementation of OpenID Connect.

| **Single Sign-on / Sign-out** 
| Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

| **Access Control for APIs** 
| Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and native/mobile apps.

| **Federation Gateway**
| Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc. This shields your applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

| **Focus on Customization**
| The most important part - many aspects of Open.IdentityServer can be customized to fit **your** needs. Since Open.IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product or a SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.

| **Mature Open Source**
| Open.IdentityServer uses the permissive `Apache 2 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ license that allows building commercial products on top of it.

| **Free and Commercial Support**
| If you need help building or running your identity platform, :ref:`let us know <refSupport>`. There are several ways we can help you out.
